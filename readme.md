## FIREBALL!
_(A personal project for brushing up on front-end skills)_
<br>***This is a work in progress!***

This is a personal project designed to help me expand on the front-end development skills
I began learning as part of the Code Louisville course.  Its primary focus is on number generation, 
dynamic styling, and some minor DOM manipulation through Javascript.  There is only one page as
part of this project.

### The Basic Idea:
The tabletop game Dungeons & Dragons (and others of its ilk) will occasionally require multiple
rolls of a certain type of die.  As this is easily done through a random number generator, I
created a basic form to enter the number of dice and what type, with a few color and graphical
flourishes just for fun.

### To Use:
The user enters the number of dice being rolled (in the field `# of Dice`) and what type of 
die is being rolled (in the `Sides on Die` drop-down).  The chosen die type will display
graphically below the form controls.
When the user hits `Roll!`, the total of all rolls will display under `Total`,
with each individual roll value being output beneath that, under `Roll by Roll`.

### Notes:
The color of the die graphic and the output containers is randomly determined at page load.
Try refreshing a few times and see what you can come up with!
